Java 
exception handling, collections(tree, graph)
Date timeAPI, Optional, Comparable vs Comparator.. generics, recursion, memory management & garbage collection,
file handling, binomial heap, range tree.. dequeue and queue, multithreading & concurrency
core java - super, this, final keywords

codekata -> walkthrough --> done

javascript -> 1/2hr only taken, but not clear.. bootstrap.. html and css

Git -> clear basics -> adding into repository, git init, git add, git commit, git push, stash,.. 

git to be covered : fetch, merge, rebase, status, pull, git branching

sql -> from constraints, jdbc connectivity

matrix problem
reading i/p from user
codekata

Problem solving skills -> 

divide and conquer..

IDE -> eclipse, sts (spring tool suite) -> almost similar
IntelliJ -> advanced features.. two types 1. community edition (free and open source), 2. ultimate edition (paid, free tier for first 15-30days)

jdk -> open jdk : oracle/amazon

jdk version should be compatible with IDE..

version 1 -> your game app..
playstore/app store -> version 2.. 

22/04

New Project -> select language, select build tool -> maven, gradle

packages -> classes -> methods/functions -> objects or variables (local & global)

.jar(.exe) -> build tools..

core java - super, this, final keywords: 

this : refers to current object 
super : refers to superclass or parent methods or variables
final : can't modify a value (variable), in case of class -> can't extend., method level -> can't overrride method

immutable -> can't modify 
	. make your class as final
	. make your fields as private
	. you will not have setters only getters
	. mutable fields final
	. initialize using a constructor

generics -> ensure type safety
	generic class(List), type parameters : T -> type, E -> element, K -> key, N -> number, V -> value
	generic method
	type casting -> from one data type you are converting to datatype

recursion -> making a function to call itself

collections -> framework (store data & manipulate data) -> search, sort, insertion, manipulation, deletion etc

				Iterable(interface)
				    ..

				  Collection

		List        Queue        Set     Map  


List -> insertion order
	ArrayList :  non-synchrnoized : add, remove, contains, get
	LinkedList :  non-synchrnoized : add, remove, contains, get
	Vector : synchronized : add, remove, contains, get
		. stack : push(add), insertion order Last In first Out : pop(remove), peek(top element), get

synchronous -> one action happens only at one time.. Collections.synchronizedList()

Queue : First in First Out : poll, remove, contains, peek, element
	. Priority queue - no insertion order
	. array dequeue - insertion order

Dequeue : add/delete the elements either at last or first position
